			<p style="font-size: 20px;"><br>Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds.<br> In humans, these viruses cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal.<br> Mild illnesses include some cases of the common cold (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses),<br> while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19. Symptoms in other species vary: in chickens,<br> they cause an upper respiratory tract disease, while in cows and pigs they cause diarrhea. <br>There are as yet no vaccines or antiviral drugs to prevent or treat human coronavirus infections.
				<br><br>Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses. They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.
